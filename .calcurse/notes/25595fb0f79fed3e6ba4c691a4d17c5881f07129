TAKE NOTE:

The startupscript.sh might not be running at startup.
These are the programs that should be started.
	- mpdscribble
	- wal [with skyview background]
	- polyboot
	- mpd
	- walcolors.sh
	- i3 bar should be killed

When run seperately, it works perfectly. No bugs are within the script itself.

Running seperately isn't too big an issue.
