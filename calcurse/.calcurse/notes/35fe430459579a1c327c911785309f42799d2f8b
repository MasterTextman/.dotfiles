This isn't indefinitely, but it is incredibly hard to build.
I tried many things, but the configuration of the whole matter is so tiresome, it doesn't feel worth it.
This one is suspended until I can find a comprehensive tutorial on how I can make mutt work.
I'm too inexperienced regarding IMAP and email clients in that area, especially on linux.

#FINAL CONCLUSION
     I have concluded that installing and configuring mutt isn't worth it in the end.
     It is causing too much trouble, and all this to have a terminal client.
     I'll attempt to install when I'm advanced enough - but right now it is torture.
