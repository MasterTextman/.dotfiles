Since I am now using urxvt, powerline-shell is just too buggy to actually use.
As a result, I have edited the $PS1 of the bash, and am now using that as a result.

Plus, "wal" wasn't working well with it. The text kept being too similarly-coloured to be visible.
I'd rather have an edited $PS1 with wal than powerline unfortunately.

That is all.
