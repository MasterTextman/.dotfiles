# .dotfiles
Configuration [and others]

# how to install
these dotfiles were tested for Ubuntu and Manjaro, and hence can be used for `apt` and `pacman`. to install, run `dotfileinstall.sh` for `apt`, and `dtpacmaninstall.sh` for `pacman`.

# what will happen?
all the programs i normally use will be installed, and the configuration files will be placed accordingly using `stow`. if you don't want a program, you can comment it out in the script - though some programs are necessary for the whole script to run, like `stow`
